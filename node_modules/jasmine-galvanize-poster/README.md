# jasmine-galvanize-poster
Jasmine runner that sends results to a node app, which talks with students.galvanize.com


This currently reads from the `gschool.json` file to determine which endpoint to send the results to.

To use in your specs, install this module and set the following in any spec file that needs the module. Then use jasmine like normal.

```
var reporter = require('jasmine-galvanize-poster');
jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(reporter);
```
